## Premise of the game:
You are space man who only have one mission. Collect food from space and **avoid colliding** with the dangerous planets. You only have **_one life_** so be careful. The more food you collect the more points you get. But also more planets will spawn. All the planets have different **sizes** and **gravity**. So dont get too close to the big ones. Good luck!
